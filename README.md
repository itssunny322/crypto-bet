# crypto-bet
Our Idea is to implement transparent betting and gambling applications over blockchain.

# Description
As we all are aware that betting market is huge , people across the globe place millions of
dollars combined on a single match someday, so we came across the idea why not to make a
web app based on blockchain where people can enjoy betting with true transparency, to avoid
the problems people facing each day like delayed withdrawal, getting banned from website and
many other things . This will be solving everything in near future, we will be using automated
odds adjuster for defining the odds , details for same written below :

 - Writing smart contracts for the whole betting application.
 - Admin can add new bets, declare outcome of bets, register new tokens
 - Only the registered tokens are allowed for deposit,withdrawal and bet.
 - Users can bet freely with restriction.
 - Users can either deposit and bet or do instant flashbet.
 - Automated odds maker for match odds
 - Instant Withdrawal or deposit for all users using crypto wallets.
 - Right now we are only dealing with Stable coins.

## Potential Impact & Business Value :
As we all are aware that this market is huge and right now we don't have much competitor in
market so if we go in right now with this product, we can make huge business impact and make hell
out of profit from it , a good betting wetsite on web2 make around 200-300$ per day just by attracting users 
to use the service over their website and there's so many problems users facing right now over web2 platform
our web3 platform will almost eliminate all these problems 

## Revenue system :
Well right now we are giving 100% back to the users, suppose User1 place 100$ on TeamA and
User2 place 100$ on TeamB (consider 1:1 complete odds) and TeamA wins , then we are giving 200$ to TeamA right now which can be reduced to 185-190$(included gas fee) so admin can get 10-15$ profit , consider 1 million $ worth bet placed on a match ,admin can get 50k USD to 75k USD, (thatâ€™s how the site owner or we makes the profit)
